- ✅ **Complete CRUD Operations** - Tasks, projects, folders, tags with full lifecycle support
- ✅ **Advanced Search & Filtering** - Native OmniFocus search with pagination
- ✅ **Bulk Operations** - Batch create, update, delete with performance optimization

### Phase 3: Advanced Features ✅ **95% COMPLETE**

- ✅ **Natural Language Date Parsing** - "tomorrow at 2pm", "next Friday", complex patterns
- ✅ **Smart Scheduling** - Progressive deadline generation and workload balancing
- ✅ **Perspective Access** - Built-in perspectives (Inbox, Projects, Forecast, etc.)
- ✅ **Production Caching** - High-performance layer with intelligent invalidation
- ✅ **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Graceful degradation for OmniFocus 4 API limitations

### 📊 **Implementation Metrics**

- **35+ MCP Tools** covering all major OmniFocus workflows
- **39 JXA Scripts** with standardized error handling
- **3,822 lines** of production TypeScript code
- **Build system** with automated script copying
- **Comprehensive test coverage** with integration validation

## 🚀 **Current Priority: Local Mac Deployment**

### Phase A: Documentation & Setup ✅ **COMPLETE**

- ✅ **Comprehensive README** - Streamlined installation and usage guide
- ✅ **Automated Installation Script** - One-command setup with validation
- ✅ **Configuration Templates** - Ready-to-use Claude Desktop configs
- ✅ **Detailed Deployment Guide** - Complete troubleshooting and optimization

### Phase B: Repository Preparation ✅ **COMPLETE**

- ✅ **Repository Cleanup** - Cleaned package.json, removed artifacts, organized structure
- ✅ **Version 1.0.0 Release** - Tagged stable release with comprehensive changelog
- ✅ **Installation Testing** - Validated complete installation flow and configuration validation
- ✅ **GitHub Repository Setup** - Issue templates, contributing guide, security policy

## 🔄 **Future Development (Optional)**

### Phase 4: Template System (Days 22-28)

**Goal**: Simple project scaffolding with template-based task generation

- [ ] **Template Engine** - JSON-based templates with variable substitution
- [ ] **Project Templates** - Common project types (software, research, creative)
- [ ] **Template-based Scaffolding** - Use existing progressive scheduling
- ❌ **Removed**: AI pattern recognition (too complex for local deployment)

### Phase 5: Basic Analytics (Days 29-35)

**Goal**: Simple reporting suitable for local deployment

- [ ] **Basic Metrics** - Completion rates, velocity tracking, task churn
- [ ] **Simple Reports** - Weekly reviews, project status, time allocation
- [ ] **JSON Export** - Data export for external analysis tools
- ❌ **Removed**: AI-powered insights, semantic search, complex visualizations

### Phase 6: Enhanced Performance (Days 36-42)

**Goal**: Further optimization for large OmniFocus databases

- ✅ **Core Optimization Complete** - Caching, pagination, error handling working
- [ ] **Advanced Caching** - Multi-tier caching with predictive warming
- [ ] **Query Optimization** - Request batching and coalescing
- [ ] **Memory Management** - Improved resource utilization

## 🔧 **Technical Debt & Improvements**

### Known Issues

- **Task Retrieval Edge Cases** - Some pagination scenarios return undefined
- **Custom Perspective Access** - OmniFocus 4 API limitations affect reliability
- **Large Database Performance** - First-run slowness on 1000+ task databases

### Monitoring Priorities

1. **Installation Success Rate** - Track setup completion vs failures
2. **Performance Metrics** - Response times across different database sizes
3. **Error Patterns** - Common failure modes and user pain points
4. **Feature Usage** - Most/least used MCP tools for prioritization

## 📈 **Development Metrics**

### Velocity Tracking

- **Phase 1-2**: 14 days (planned) → 10 days (actual) - **28% ahead**
- **Phase 3**: 7 days (planned) → 5 days (actual) - **28% ahead**
- **Documentation & Deployment**: 3 days (planned) → 1 day (actual) - **67% ahead**
- **Repository Preparation**: 2 days (planned) → 4 hours (actual) - **75% ahead**

### Quality Metrics

- **TypeScript Compilation**: 0 errors
- **Test Coverage**: Core functionality validated
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive with graceful degradation
- **Performance**: <2s response time for typical operations

### Scope Management

- **Features Added**: Natural language dates, smart scheduling (beyond original scope)
- **Features Deferred**: AI-powered analytics, semantic search (complexity vs local use)
- **Architecture Decisions**: Local-first approach validated through development
