# Focus Pocus - OmniFocus MCP Server

Connect Claude Desktop to OmniFocus with comprehensive task management, natural language date parsing, and intelligent automation.

## What is Focus Pocus?

Focus Pocus is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables Claude Desktop to interact with your OmniFocus tasks, projects, and workflows. Ask Claude to manage your tasks naturally: _"Create a task for tomorrow"_, _"Show me overdue items"_, or _"Schedule my remaining work optimally"_.

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Complete Task Management** - Create, update, delete tasks and projects  
‚úÖ **Natural Language Dates** - "tomorrow at 2pm", "next Friday", "in 3 days"  
‚úÖ **Bulk Operations** - Process multiple tasks efficiently  
‚úÖ **Smart Scheduling** - Optimal task distribution and workload balancing  
‚úÖ **Tag & Project Organization** - Full hierarchy support  
‚úÖ **Built-in Perspectives** - Access Inbox, Forecast, Flagged, and more

## Requirements

- **macOS 10.15+**
- **OmniFocus** (any version)
- **Node.js 18+**
- **Claude Desktop**

## Installation

### Automated Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/drcdev/focus-pocus.git
cd focus-pocus

# 2. Run the installation script
./install.sh
```

The script will:

- ‚úÖ Check all prerequisites
- ‚úÖ Install dependencies and build the project
- ‚úÖ Set up macOS automation permissions
- ‚úÖ Configure Claude Desktop automatically
- ‚úÖ Test the complete installation

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# 1. Install and build
git clone https://github.com/drcdev/focus-pocus.git
cd focus-pocus
npm install && npm run build

# 2. Configure Claude Desktop
# Edit: ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "focus-pocus": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/focus-pocus/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}

# 3. Grant automation permissions when prompted
# 4. Restart Claude Desktop
```

> **Note**: Replace `drcdev` with the actual repository owner and `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/focus-pocus` with your installation path.

## Quick Start

After installation:

1. **Launch OmniFocus** and **Claude Desktop**
2. **Test the connection** by asking Claude:

```
Can you show me my current tasks in OmniFocus?
```

3. **Try these example commands**:

```
# Basic operations
Create a task "Review project proposal" due tomorrow
Show me all tasks in my "Work" project
Mark the task "Buy groceries" as complete

# Natural language dates
Create a task "Team meeting" for next Monday at 10am
Schedule "Finish report" for Friday afternoon

# Advanced features
Show me my overdue tasks
Schedule my remaining tasks optimally this week
What's in my Forecast for today?
```

For detailed development setup, see [docs/local-deployment.md](docs/local-deployment.md)

## Troubleshooting

### Quick Fixes

**"Command not found: node"**  
‚Üí Install Node.js 18+ from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or `brew install node`

**"Not Authorized" or "Automation Error"**  
‚Üí Grant automation permissions: **System Preferences** ‚Üí **Security & Privacy** ‚Üí **Privacy** ‚Üí **Automation** ‚Üí Enable your terminal app for OmniFocus

**"Cannot find module" errors**  
‚Üí Run `npm install && npm run build`

**"MCP server not found"**  
‚Üí Check absolute path in Claude Desktop config: `cd focus-pocus && pwd`

**Connection timeouts**  
‚Üí Large databases are slower on first run - subsequent requests use cache

## Configuration

Focus Pocus works great out of the box. For advanced users, customize via environment variables in your Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "focus-pocus": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/focus-pocus/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "LOG_LEVEL": "info",
        "JXA_TIMEOUT": "45000",
        "CACHE_MAX_SIZE": "500",
        "DEFAULT_LIMIT": "25"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Performance Tips:**

- **Large databases (1000+ tasks)**: Increase `JXA_TIMEOUT` to `60000`
- **Limited memory**: Reduce `CACHE_MAX_SIZE` to `100`
- **Debugging**: Set `LOG_LEVEL` to `debug`
